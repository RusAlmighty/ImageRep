# Multipale Image Neural Representations
Based on 
[Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions](https://github.com/vsitzmann/siren)

## Setup enviroment

Setup a conda environment with all dependencies like so:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ImageRep
```
## Train image representation
run training

```
python train.py
```
Please make sure to login to [wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) before staring training.
The checkpoints stored at "output" folder.

### Evaluate
to produce evaluation images
```
python eval_trained.py [checkpoint path]
```
the result will be two image
